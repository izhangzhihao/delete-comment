# Github Action to delete comments by username

Delete-comment Action will delete comments from issues/prs by username. You can either 
specify an issue number on which to remove comments or let the action remove all comments
across the repository.

## Sample Manually Triggered Workflow

```yaml
name: delete comments from open-collective-bot
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  delete-comments:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: izhangzhihao/delete-comment@master
        with: 
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          comment_body: LCOV
